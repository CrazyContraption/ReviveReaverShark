Revive Reaver Shark is a simple mod. - Last Updated 3/03/2023

Reaver Shark was murdered by ReLogic.
So we brought it back to life - better than ever.

The Reaver Shark will now scale progressively with you depending on the bosses defeated in the world.
The stats are immediately adjusted to the current world, and will always be powered around what your progression is.

This mod doesn't let you cheat, but it does give the Reaver the respect it rightly deserves.

"But this mod makes the game unbalanced, now I don't have to craft xyz!"
The time you save not needing to craft a new pick is offset by its relatively slow mining speed in hardmode, and no axe stats.
While this mod makes Reaver viable late-game, it is by no means your best option at any given time post-hardmode.

This mod is excellent for drop-in players that need to catch up to progression quickly, or players that hate ore upgrade grinds.


Progressions are as follows:
59% <- Base
60% <- King Slime
64% <- Eye of Cthulhu
70% <- Any Corruption Boss
80% <- Queen Bee
90% <- Skeletron
100% <- Deerclops
110% <- Wall of Flesh
150% <- Queen Slime
180% <- Any Mech Boss
200% <- All Mech Bosses
205% <- Plantera
210% <- Golem
220% <- Cultist
225% <- Any Tower
235% <- All Towers
255% <- Empress of Light
275% <- Moon Lord or Duke Fishron
285% <- Moon Lord and Duke Fishron
300% <- Moon Lord, Empress, and Fishron


You can also set the mod to ONLY un-nerf Reaver Shark back to 100% pick power in the included config.
Swapping between the two modes in-game is supported, settings of the world host are used by default.
