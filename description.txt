Revive Reaver Shark is a simple mod. - Last Updated 2/27/2023

Reaver Shark was murdered by ReLogic.
So we brought it back to life - better than ever.

The Reaver Shark will now scale progressively depending on the bosses defeated in the world.
The stats are immediately adjusted to the current world, and will always be powered around what your progression is.

This mod doesn't let you cheat, but it does give the Reaver the respect it rightly deserves.
