Revive Reaver Shark is a simple mod.

Reaver Shark was murdered by ReLogic.
So we brought it back to life - better than ever.

The Reaver Shark will now scale progressively depending on the bosses defeated in the world.
The stats are adjusted to the current world, and will always be powered around what your progression is.

This mod doesn't let you cheat, but it does give the Reaver the respect it rightly deserves.

Progressions is as follows:
59% <- Base
59% <- Eye of Cthulhu
70% <- Any Corruption Boss
80% <- Queen Bee
90% <- Skeletron
100% <- Deerclops
110% <- Wall of Flesh
150% <- Queen Slime
170% <- Any Mech Boss
200% <- All Mech Bosses
205% <- Plantera
210% <- Golem
220% <- Cultist
225% <- Any Tower
230% <- All Towers
250% <- Moon Lord
300% <- Empress of Light
